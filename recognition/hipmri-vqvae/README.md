# HipMRI 2D Reconstruction with VAE and VQ-VAE

## Project status

Stage 3 experiment pipeline. The downloaded HipMRI slices have been inspected, the official patient-level splits have been verified, and end-to-end training, validation, checkpoint loading, metric export, and failure-case visualisation have been tested with both model architectures. No final trained-model results are claimed yet.

## Research question

Under the same patient-level data split, preprocessing, training budget, and evaluation protocol, does a VQ-VAE provide a better reconstruction-quality and representation-efficiency trade-off than a continuous-latent convolutional VAE on 2D HipMRI slices?

## Models

- **Baseline:** convolutional VAE with a continuous spatial latent tensor.
- **Hard model:** VQ-VAE with a learned discrete codebook and straight-through estimator.

The encoder and decoder capacity are intentionally similar so that the comparison focuses on continuous versus vector-quantised latent representations.

## Verified dataset inventory

The source data are the course-provided HipMRI 2D NIfTI slices. Raw data are local-only and ignored by Git.

| Split | MRI slices | Masks | Patient IDs |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Train | 11,460 | 11,460 | 004–033 and 035 |
| Validation | 660 | 660 | 036–039 |
| Test | 540 | 540 | 040–042 |

The filename key `(patient, week, slice)` pairs every MRI with exactly one segmentation mask. The patient sets are disjoint across all three splits. Of the 12,660 MRI slices, 12,600 have shape `256 x 128`; the 60 slices from patient 019 have shape `256 x 144`. MRI values are non-negative `float32`; masks are `uint8` labels with observed values 0–5.

## Deterministic preprocessing

`dataset.py` implements the following fixed pipeline:

1. Discover the official train, validation, and test directories.
2. Pair `case_...nii.gz` and `seg_...nii.gz` files by patient, week, and slice.
3. Reject missing pairs, duplicate keys, malformed filenames, or patient overlap.
4. Load each 2D NIfTI slice without modifying the source file.
5. Clip each MRI at the 99.5th percentile of its positive pixels and scale it to `[0, 1]`.
6. Centre-pad with zeros to `256 x 144`; no image content is cropped.
7. Preserve the integer segmentation mask for later region-aware evaluation.

The per-slice normalisation is deterministic and does not use labels or statistics from other patients. Its trade-off is that absolute scanner-intensity differences between slices are removed; this limitation must be considered when interpreting results.

## Environment and manifest

From this directory:

```bash
conda activate 3710torch
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python dataset.py \
  --data-root data/keras_slices_data \
  --output data/manifest.csv
```

The generated manifest contains relative MRI/mask paths plus patient, week, slice, and split identifiers. Both the raw data and manifest remain under the ignored `data/` directory.

## Training and validation

`train.py` evaluates the validation split after every epoch and writes:

- `best.pt`: checkpoint with the lowest validation loss;
- `last.pt`: checkpoint from the most recent epoch;
- `history.csv`: per-epoch loss, reconstruction metrics, timings, and VQ codebook statistics;
- `config.json`: data, optimiser, reproducibility, software, device, and parameter-count settings;
- `summary.json`: best epoch, runtime, parameter count, device, and peak CUDA memory when available.

Example local sanity run:

```bash
python train.py \
  --model vae \
  --manifest data/manifest.csv \
  --output outputs/sanity-vae \
  --epochs 2 \
  --batch-size 4 \
  --max-train-batches 6 \
  --max-validation-batches 3 \
  --device cpu
```

The batch-limit options mark the run as limited in `summary.json`. They are for pipeline checks only and must not be used for final model claims.

## Checkpoint evaluation

During development, evaluate only the validation split:

```bash
python predict.py \
  --checkpoint outputs/sanity-vae/best.pt \
  --manifest data/manifest.csv \
  --split validation \
  --output predictions/sanity-vae \
  --max-batches 3 \
  --device cpu
```

The command saves per-sample MSE, MAE, PSNR, and windowed SSIM to `metrics.csv`, aggregated values to `summary.json`, and a panel of the highest-MSE cases to `worst_reconstructions.png`. VQ-VAE evaluations additionally report codebook perplexity, active codes, dead codes, and active-code fraction. The untouched test split should be evaluated only after both final models and the comparison protocol have been frozen.

## Smoke tests

Software-only model test:

```bash
python train.py --smoke-test
```

The data-loader verification produced batches with shape `[N, 1, 256, 144]`, `float32` MRI values in `[0, 1]`, and integer masks. Both VAE and VQ-VAE returned reconstructions of the same shape.

An intentionally limited CPU run also verified the full artifact pipeline. The ConvVAE completed two epochs over 6 training and 3 validation batches per epoch, selected epoch 2 as the best checkpoint, and reloaded it using PyTorch's safe `weights_only=True` mode. A one-epoch VQ-VAE check verified codebook statistics and exposed the expected near-initial code usage of 2/512 active entries. These observations verify software behaviour only; they are not model-quality evidence and must not be compared as final results.

## Planned evaluation

- Reconstruction: MSE, MAE, PSNR, and SSIM on the fixed test split.
- VQ-VAE representation: codebook perplexity, active-code fraction, and dead codes.
- Resources: parameter count, training time, inference time, and peak accelerator memory.
- Qualitative analysis: original/reconstruction/error-map panels for 3–5 representative lower-performing test cases.
- Region-aware analysis using the supplied masks without training on the test labels.
- Recommendation based on quality, stability, resource use, and observed failure modes.

## Required files

- `modules.py`: ConvVAE, vector quantiser, VQ-VAE, and loss functions.
- `dataset.py`: NIfTI discovery, pairing, leakage checks, manifest generation, and loading.
- `metrics.py`: shared MSE, MAE, PSNR, and windowed SSIM implementation.
- `train.py`: training, validation, best-checkpoint selection, configuration, and history logging.
- `predict.py`: safe checkpoint loading, per-sample evaluation, and failure-case visualisation.
- `README.md`: experiment protocol, commands, evidence, and findings.

## Immediate next steps

1. Prepare Rangpur interactive and Slurm commands with a fixed resource budget.
2. Run a short GPU feasibility experiment and choose a justified epoch/batch budget.
3. Train the ConvVAE baseline under the frozen budget.
4. Train the VQ-VAE using the same data, hardware, and budget while monitoring codebook collapse.
5. Evaluate both frozen checkpoints once on the untouched test patients.
6. Record failure cases, resource statistics, and final engineering recommendations.
